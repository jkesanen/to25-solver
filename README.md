Solves To 25 game's boards.

## The game

As I don't know the name of this game, which I learned in elementary school from a classmate, I'll call it "To 25". The game is played on a 5x5 board of squares. You'll try to fill in the numbers from 1 to 25.

The best occasion to play this game is while you should be actually listening to someone, but instead of paying attention or taking notes you'll play this game into the margins of cross-ruled papers.

## Game rules

* You'll have a board of 5 x 5 squares.
* Write number 1 to the top-left corner.
* Increment number by one.
* The next number goes into a free square which is either:
  * 3 squares up, down, left OR right from the current number (skip two squares).
  * 2 squares diagonally from the current number (skip one square).
* By following these rules you'll try to get to number 25 by filling all the squares on the board.
